                            Let's talk about your experiences with worry and anxiety. Are there specific situations or thoughts that typically trigger your anxiety?\
                            How would you describe the impact of these worries on your daily life and well-being?\
                            Do you know that you shouldn't worry about things, but you just can't help it?\
                            From the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, one question asks how often you find yourself worrying about various things. How would you answer that, and could you give some examples?\
                            Reflecting on the Metacognitions Questionnaire, are there beliefs about worrying that you find yourself agreeing with? For example, do you believe worrying helps you to avoid problems, or do you worry about worrying too much?\
                            Considering our work together, what are some goals you hope to achieve through therapy?\
                            Do you start worrying about everything else you have to do as soon as you complete something?\
                            Are there particular aspects of your anxiety or worry that you'd like to understand better or manage more effectively?\
                            If there's nothing more you can do about something, do you also stop worrying about it?\
                            Do you notice that you worry about things?\
